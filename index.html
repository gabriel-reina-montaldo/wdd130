            <p>Hello! My name is Gabriel Reina and I am from Montevideo, Uruguay. I enjoy playing and watching football with my friends. I'm currently playing in a football league with my team called 'Atletico Helaman'. My position in the field is Forward. I also love music. I play the piano and the guitar and try to sing. My favorite music genres are rock, pop and jazz. When I was 18, I was called to serv a mission in Brasilia, Brasil. It was a beautiful experience in which I learned essential things for my life. I learnt a lot more about the gospel and felt the love that God has for me. Earlier this year I had the best time of my life when I got married with my wife, Laura.  </p>
